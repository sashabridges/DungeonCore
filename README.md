## What is "DungeonCore"?
DungeonCore is a cute little C# and .NET terminal game based on DungeonCore LitRPG fiction.
In those stories, the protagonist starts out as the "core" of a dungeon, essentially the dungeon's brain, heart, soul, and master.
DungeonCore is entirely based on this premise!

First, you give yourself a name!
Then, your attributes are randomly generated.
These starter attributes are your core's Color, Shape, your starting Landscape, and the first plant, animal, and minerals you find.

Current planned features:
- add starter animals and minerals :white_check_mark:
- add random events that can occur - in progress!
- add saving player data to json files :white_check_mark:
- add loading player data from json files :white_check_mark:
- and more! :white_check_mark:
